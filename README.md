# CS210Project1
This was my very first C++ project for CS210 (Programming Languages) at SNHU

* Project Summary:
This C++ project creates a clock that the user interacts with by using a menu in the console.  The menu allows you to add hours, minutes, and seconds, and displays time in both 12-hour format and 24-hour format.   

* What I did well:
What I believe I did well on this project, was creating a 'clock' class to encapsulate the the clock functionality, which helps with modularity and reusability of the code. I also created a user-friendly menu to interact with.

* What I could have improved upon:
Areas that I could have improved upon would be the design of the clock interface, which would make it look more appealing and professional. I also could do better with the error handling, because there is input validationa dn where there is input validation, there is always the chance for many errors. Preparing to handle the errors can lead to better, more efficient code. I also could have added more comments to help others understand the code better. 

* Challenges while coding:
I definitely found programming the clock interface very challenging, and I think ti is the weakest point in my code. I struggled to get the '*' to align correctly. I really just spent a lot of time trying new things and did the best I could. I could not find any resources to help in this aspect. 

* Skills from this project that will transfer to other projects or course work:
Skills learned from this project that can transfer to other projects and course material are the object-oriented programming skills from the clock class, and the input/output handling of the user input,  which is essential in any code or project. 

* How I made this program maintainable, adaptable, and readable:
Using a clock class allows you to modify or enhance the program easily without affecting the rest of the code. This allows for easy maintaining and adapting of the code itself Using whitespace and comments help the readability, and help any other user read and understand how I created the code and how it functions.
